## Description

In the welcome screen, the CookUp Login screen is displayed where the user can log in or sign up for an account.  After successfully logging in, three buttons are shown:

1. Find Recipes:  after the user enters one or more ingredients of their desired dish, a list of matching recipes is displayed.  Tapping on a recipe from the list displays the recipe's details, which include: the recipe's name, source, rating, web link to "Get the Recipe", and the recipe's ingredients.  Tapping on "Get the Recipe" launches the web page containing more details and the cooking directions.  A "Save Recipe" button appears at the bottom of the recipe detail screen.  Tapping on the button saves the recipe to the user's list of saved recipes.

2. My Saved Recipes:  displays the user's list of saved recipes.  The user can organize their list of recipes by dragging a recipe to a different position in the list. The user can delete a recipe from their list by swiping the recipe to the left. Tapping on a recipe redisplays the recipe's details as described above.

3. About:  displays a short description of the CookUp app

The user can log out of the CookUp app by tapping on the three vertical dots at the top right corner of the screen and selecting the "Logout" option.
